# Azure Policy Aliases

Searching policy aliases is hard..

Why not index it and make it searchable?

Idea:

- Script that runs periodically to fetch aliases
  - Save to json? Or just generate markdown?

- Searchable web frontend for all policies

- Hosted on Container Apps or something like that
  - Should be static site, light-weight
